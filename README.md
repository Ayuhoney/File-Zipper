A huffman coding library and command line interface to the library. The encoder is a 2 pass encoder. The first pass generates a huffman tree and the second pass encodes the data. The decoder is one pass and uses a huffman code table at the beginning of the compressed file to decode the data.
lib huffman has functions for encoding and decoding both files and memory.

The Huffmans algo creates a 1-1 mapping for each byte of the input file and replaces each byte with the
mapped bit sequence.
ï‚· Unlike Huffmans code dont need an extra dictionary to be saved. Also create a mapping to byte sequence
It creates mapping of multiple byte to binary sequence.
